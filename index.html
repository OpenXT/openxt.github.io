OpenXT is an open-source development toolkit for hardware-assisted security research and appliance integration. It includes hardened Xen VMs that can be configured as a user-facing virtualization appliance, for client devices with Linux and/or Windows guests.  

<br><br>

It has been used to develop managed software appliances to isolate demanding graphics workloads, untrusted workloads and multiple networks on a single laptop or desktop.
OpenXT is optimized for x86 devices with Intel VT-d, TPM and TXT (Trusted Execution Technology).

<br><br>

Client appliances developed on OpenXT can contain a mixture of open-source and proprietary software, supporting a variety of business models.
