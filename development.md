Please read the [contribution](https://github.com/OpenXT/openxt/wiki/Contributing) guidelines. There are 50+ source repositories on [Github](https://github.com/openxt), with [build instructions](https://github.com/OpenXT/openxt/wiki/How%20to%20build%20OpenXT).  Issues and enhancements are tracked in [JIRA](https://openxt.atlassian.net).

The documents below are dated, especially with respect to video architecture, but may be useful to new developers.  They need to be converted to the Github wiki and edited to correct/remove dated sections.
