Please read the [contribution](https://github.com/OpenXT/openxt/wiki/Contributing) guidelines. There are 50+ source repositories on [Github](https://github.com/openxt), with [build instructions](https://github.com/OpenXT/openxt/wiki/How%20to%20build%20OpenXT).  Issues are tracked in [JIRA](https://openxt.atlassian.net).

We are hosting a [mirror](http://openxt.org/mirror) of 3rd-party components needed for an appliance build. Please cache these files locally and build from your local mirror. The system hosting the mirror has limited bandwidth. 

Questions and feedback are welcome on the [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/openxt).
