OpenXT is a development platform for the security and virtualization communities, a toolkit for hardware-assisted separation of operating systems and user workflows for tailored solutions.

Released as open-source software in 2014, OpenXT was derived from [Citrix XenClient XT](https://web.archive.org/web/20130529200255/http://www.citrix.com:80/news/announcements/may-2011/citrix-announces-xenclient-2-and-xenclient-xt.html), released in 2011.  XenClient XT was an early commercial adopter of Intel TXT and [Secure Virtual Platform (SVP)](https://github.com/OpenXT/docs/raw/master/presentations/2016-06-07-openxt-summit/03%20-%20Loscocco%20-%20Virtual%20Platform%20Research.pdf) concepts from the Trusted Systems Research group of the U.S. National Security Agency.
